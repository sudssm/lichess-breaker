a simple captcha breaker for http://en.lichess.org/signup

NOTE: doesn't work after lichess modified the mini_board div to no longer include board FEN notation in data-fen. The breaker needs to be improved to parse positional information from the cg-board class into FEN notation.

Requirements: node

Instructions:
  check out the repository
  npm install
  ./makeAccounts.sh <number of accounts>
  
<number of accounts> users will be created. The usernames will be appended to the end of users.txt. The password for all accounts will be "pwned"
